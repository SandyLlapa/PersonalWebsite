I proactively networked with families to secure babysitting opportunities, always adhering to the specific guidelines and rules set by parents. To foster a nurturing learning environment, I personally invested in age-appropriate educational materials and engaged children with activities tailored to their developmental stage. In addition to supervising playtime, I provided academic support by assisting with school homework and creating educational exercises. I also took the initiative to teach English to Spanish-speaking children and introduced basic Spanish vocabulary to children learning the language. Throughout my time in this role, I maintained a vigilant focus on safety and ensured that all activities were conducted in a secure and hazard-free environment.',

      description: 'As a Volunteer Tutor, I assisted students with software and security-related questions, focusing on tools and concepts that were difficult for many, such as American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), GDB, and hex editors. With limited in-class guidance, I took the initiative to self-learn these tools and shared my knowledge with peers, helping them navigate the complexities of debugging and reverse engineering. I also provided instruction on memory-related security vulnerabilities, explaining how the memory layout of a program could expose weaknesses and lead to exploits. In addition to hands-on guidance in class, I supported students by answering questions efficiently via email, ensuring they had the resources and understanding needed to succeed. My role allowed me to foster a deeper understanding of software security and debugging techniques among my peers.',

This involved careful visual inspection of each blade and placing them neatly onto gel packs in a clean, dust-free environment. I also handled labeling by printing and verifying order information, and maintained accurate documentation for every completed order. When high-priority orders came in, I would immediately assist coworkers to ensure timely fulfillment. After inspection and documentation, I transferred orders to the packaging team. I followed cleanroom protocols by wearing protective gear to maintain a sanitized workspace. In addition to blade inspection, I cut, inspected, and packaged elastomers for semiconductor applications, ensuring consistency and quality across all materials. Throughout my time in this role, I maintained a spotless record with no quality complaints or packaging errors.',
